### Hi there 👋

Hello! I'm Mya, a new software developer eager to collaborate on exciting projects. At the moment, I'm primarily focusing on enhancing my skills in JavaScript. However, I have some experience with Pyomo from a previous net-zero project. If you have any interesting ideas or opportunities, feel free to get in touch. Let's collaborate! 😊
